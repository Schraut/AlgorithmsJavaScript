// a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)
// Trees can be used to store data that has an inherent hierarchical structure.
// For example, an operating system may use a tree for directories, files and
// folders in its file management system. They are dynamic, which means that
// it is easy to add and delete nodes.
// They are easy to search and sort using standard traversal algorithms.
// They can be used to process the syntax of statements in natural and
// programming languages so are commonly used when compiling programming code.
